I would first like to thank my thesis supervisor, Ing.~Filip~KÅ™ikava,~Ph.D.,
for the introduction to this topic and thesis guidance.
I would also like to thank the Czech Technical University in Prague and
the University of Helsinki for providing me with a high-quality education.
Finally, I would like to express my very profound gratitude to my parents, family, and friends
for providing me with unfailing support and continuous encouragement throughout my years of study.
