\chap Window management

A window manager is a system software that manages windows.
That means, it controls the placement and appearance of windows within a windowing system in a graphical user interface (GUI).
It allows windows to be opened, closed, resized, or moved.
Window manager is also responsible for tracking which window is currently active and thus receiving the user's input.
Window manager can be part of a desktop environment or it can be used standalone.

\sec Desktop Environment and Window Manager

A desktop environment is an implementation of the desktop metaphor,
which was introduced by Alan Kay at Xerox PARC in 1970 to help users interact with the computer more easily~\cite[graphics].
It is based on Desktop, which resembles the top of an office desk. %todo

A desktop environment bundles together a variety of components to provide common graphical user interface elements
such as icons, toolbars, wallpapers, and desktop widgets~\cite[arch_de].
Most desktop environments also include a set of integrated applications and utilities, such as text editor, file manager or web browser.
Probably the most important part of a desktop environment is window manager.
While desktop environments provide their own window manager, it can be usually replaced with another compatible one.
Some of the most widespread desktop environments for Linux are:
\begitems
* {\sbf KDE} --
* {\sbf GNOME} -- part of the GNU Project, it aims to be simple and easy to use.
Its default display is Wayland instead of Xorg~\cite[gnome].
* {\sbf Cinnamon} -- fork of GNOME, developed to be the default desktop environment for Linux Mint~\cite[cinnamon].
It is known for its similarity to Windows user interface, so it is often recommended for new Linux users.
* {\sbf Xfce} -- one of the most lightweight desktop environments.
It aims to be fast and low on system resources, while still being visually appealing and user friendly~\cite[xfce].
