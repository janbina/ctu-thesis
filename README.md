# Master's thesis

PlainTeX source codes of my master's thesis at the [CTU in Prague](https://fit.cvut.cz).
The thesis deals with the design and implementation of window manager for the X11 Window System on Linux - the source code could be found [here](https://github.com/janbina/swm).

I used [CTUstyle](http://petr.olsak.net/ctustyle-e.html) theme for the thesis text.
I made some changes to it which you might find useful if you want to use this theme:
* switched positions of English and Czech abstract
* introduced separate counter for listings and created list of listings right after list of tables and figures
* created some macros (see `macros.tex`) - for one-line source code insertion from a file, subtle syntax highlighting of source code (modified [OPmac trick](http://petr.olsak.net/opmac-tricks-e.html)), non-numbered headline, and more
There are also slides used to present the thesis. I used a modified beamer template for those.

The thesis and slides in pdf format could be found in releases.
The source code could be found on GitHub, the version at the time of submitting the thesis was [1.0.0](https://github.com/janbina/swm/tree/1.0.0).
There is also a short video showcase on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-4S8lDN9vM). It can be also found in CTU's [dspace](https://dspace.cvut.cz/handle/10467/87816).
