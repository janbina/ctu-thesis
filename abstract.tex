    This thesis deals with the design and implementation of a stacking window manager for the X Window System.
    A window manager is the core component of any modern graphical desktop -- it is responsible
    for the placement and appearance of windows on the screen.
    While there is a plethora of window managers, especially on the X Window System, this thesis aims at creating yet another one.
    The window manager designed and implemented as part of this thesis is ICCCM and EWMH compliant,
    lightweight, easy to use, extensible, and scriptable.
    It was designed with the Unix philosophy of doing one thing well in mind.
    The code is easy to read, hackable, and tested.
