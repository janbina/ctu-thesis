    This thesis deals with the design and implementation of a stacking window manager for the X Window System.
    A window manager is the core component of any modern graphical desktop -- it is responsible
    for the placement and appearance of application windows on the screen.
    While there is a plethora of window managers, especially on the X Window System,
    most of them are either heavyweight WMs as part of a desktop environment or lightweight tiling managers.
    In this thesis, we try to fill the gap by developing a lightweight stackable WM that complies with the freedesktop
    standards such as ICCCM and EWMH, and that follows the UNIX philosophy of doing one thing and doing it well.
    The focus has been on simplicity, making it easy to use, easy to extend and easy to test.
    The focus was on code readability, testability, making it easy to hack.

%    While there is a plethora of window managers, especially on the X Window System, this thesis aims at creating yet another one.
%    The window manager designed and implemented as part of this thesis is ICCCM and EWMH compliant,
%    lightweight, easy to use, extensible, and scriptable.
%    It was designed with the Unix philosophy of doing one thing well in mind.
%    The code is easy to read, hackable, and tested.
